The "True Jesus Church" is an independent church that was established in 
Beijing, China in 1917. Today, there are approximately 1.5 million members in 
forty five countries. The church belongs to the Pentecostal branch of Christianity that emerged during the early Twentieth Century. Since 1990, the church was established in [[Samoa]]. Christmas and Easter are not celebrated. The church follows the "Jesus Only" doctrine of the Oneness Pentecostals instead of Trinity. They believe that all the teachings of the gospel must have biblical references to back it up in order to avoid misinterpretations. 

The ten basic beliefs of the church are:

#'''Holy Spirit''' - Receiving the Holy Spirit, evidenced by speaking in tongues, is the guarantee of our inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven. The church believes that "speaking in tongues" is evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit. 
#'''Baptism''' - They conduct Baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ with the person's head facing downwards and fully immersed into natural living water. 
#'''Holy Communion''' 
#'''Sabbath day''' - Unlike most other Christian denominations, the church keeps the Sabbath on Saturday instead of Sunday. 
#'''Feet washing''' 
#'''Iesu Keriso''' - Jesus Christ, the Word who became flesh, died on the cross for the redemption of sinners, resurrected on the third day and ascended to heaven. He is the only Saviour of mankind, the Creator of the heavens and earth, and the only true God.
#'''Holy Bible''' 
#'''Salvation''' is given by the grace of God through faith. 
#'''Church''' 
#'''Final Judgement''' - "The Lord's Second Coming will take place on the Last Day when He descends from heaven to judge the world: the righteous will receive eternal life, while the wicked will be eternally condemned".
