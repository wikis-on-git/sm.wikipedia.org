[[Maiavatele Pouono Hunkin]]

Maiava Pouono or sometimes Pouono to many of his friends was a school teacher and principal in his time. A member of the Hunkin 'āiga of both American Samoa and Samoan (originally called Western Samoa)he was apparently a very talented composer in the Samoan language. He according to evidence found in another part of Wikipedia (under Pu'aea Hunkin Tuiletufuga)learnt his trade from his aunty Pu'auaea Tuiletufuga of Apia village in Samoa.

Famous songs he composed included: [[Manu o le Vaveao]]. For those who want the words to this song or pese, here are the first 2 verses and chorus:

1. Manu o le vaveao tausagi i fugala'au/ 'Ae ala usu 'ita i le faiva o mafaufau/ Talu o lo'u popole, ne'i te'i 'ua lē taulau/ Ne'i pei o le 'upu 'ua lē au le Ina'ilau./

Tali:

'Aue 'a'e funa fai mai sau 'upu / 
Pe tua i ni mala ma tau i manu / 
La'u pele tau lava, tau o sina ipuvai mālū / 
'Ou te avagalima ai i tama Ta'ifau

2.
Lo'u fiafia e le teine pe tua i ni a,/ 
'Upu sa fai atu, ma le mau 'amene i luga / 
'Ae atu lo'u loto 'ona 'o sau tupua i nana, / 
ne'i lilo Utumau'u, 'ae aliali na'o Utumā./

Since the following article is being threatened to be deleted from Wikipedia (under 'Samoan composers') it is important for it to be retained here so that it can enjoy a place for referencing and referrals by researchers in and of the Samoan world. It is not easy for oral languages such as Samoan to keep up with the rules as demanded in Wikipedia,as there are few researchers who know about the many facets and aspects of the culture. So, hopefully, this section will be retained here for posterity's sake.


== '''Pu'auea Tuiletufuga Hunkin''' ==


Pu'auea Tuiletufuga Hunkin of Apia, a Samoan pese (song) composer,is remembered by many of her generation. The deceased former Member of Parliament Le'aupepe Pita of Samoa described her as a very talented woman. Pu'a (shortened form of her first name Pu'auea) created and conducted koniseti and composed Mau songs as well as other songs of her time for the Vine'ula women's group of her village of Apia. Rev. Elder Leuatea Sio, the now deceased but a well known and highly respected Samoan leader / Elder and reverend of the Pacific Islands Church in Newton, Auckland, New Zealand was also impressed by her talents and her compositions which included Vaopunimatagi and Leafaitulagi. Leuatea Sio remembered clearly his uncle(his mother Silulu Sio Iusitini's brother) by the name of Siaosi Gatoloai Peseta and another well known composer Pouono Maiava Hunkin (Pu'as nephew)of Tutuila were keen young 'apprentices' who learnt the art of composition from Pu'a. Both followed her and the Vine'ula wherever they went to perform koniseti.

A third person, the deceased Suagau McCarthy of Auckland (twin sister of Suafole) whose family is also well known in the Vaimauga district and Apia recalls how Pu'a was established in her song compositions, especially the Leafaitulagi song. Suagau and her generation were all admirers of the Vineula group and had aiga as members as well. Perhaps one of the more remarkable stories told of Pu'a's prowess and talents was that told by an old woman of Pu'a's 'āiga (family) in the village of Leonē in Apia. Loto Māta'u Tuiletufuga recounted that one of Pu'a's uncanny strengths was her ability to stand and view an important event of the moment and then verbally compose a verse or line of a song which subsequently became a song there and then. She would have other women of the Vineula group there who would sometimes assist to remember the words of some of these songs. Undoubtedly some of them would have helped to write these words down.
