Matthew "MATTT DAVEEEEEEEYYYYY" Davey is a simple folk, with three nipples and an incredibly soft soothing voice. He originates from the forests of France, with a lovably large head. Often seen in the wild with an incredibly puzzled face, he is remarkably akin to a pokemon in that he can only say his own name, "MATT DAVEY!" with varying pitches and intonation.
